Why an Open Guide?
------------------

A lot of information on Bitcoin is already written. Most people learn Bitcoin by reading a blog or a “[Bitcoin White paper](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)” and referring to the [standard AWS references](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. Here we will list some sources of information to allow anyone and African in particular to be able to educate and learn about this technology that is revolutionizing the habits of the world.

### Please help!

**This is an early in-progress draft!** It’s our first attempt at assembling this information, so is far from comprehensive still, and likely to have omissions or errors.
